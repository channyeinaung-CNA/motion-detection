# Motion Detection Using Inertial Sensors

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project explores motion detection using inertial sensors in smart devices. It compares a **traditional acceleration-based spike detection method** with **machine learning models** to classify activities like walking, sitting, and standing.

## ðŸš€ How to Contribute
### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/channyeinaung-CNA/motion-detection-project.git
cd motion-detection-project
```

### **Step 2: Create a New Branch for Your Work**
Before making any changes, create a new branch:
```bash
git checkout -b your-feature-branch
```
Replace `your-feature-branch` with a meaningful name (e.g., `ml-model`, `data-cleaning`).

### **Step 3: Work on Your Part**
Make changes to the relevant files in your branch.

### **Step 4: Add and Commit Your Changes**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
```

### **Step 5: Push Your Branch to GitHub**
```bash
git push origin your-feature-branch
```

### **Step 6: Create a Pull Request (PR)**
1. Go to **GitHub repository**.
2. Click **"Compare & pull request"** for your branch.
3. Add a short description of your changes.
4. Click **"Create pull request"**.
5. Wait for review and approval.

### **Step 7: Merge the PR (After Review)**
1. Once approved, click **"Merge pull request"**.
2. Delete the branch to keep the repo clean:
   ```bash
   git branch -d your-feature-branch
   git push origin --delete your-feature-branch
   ```

Now your changes are successfully added to the project!
